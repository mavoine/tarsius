Sorry people, the project is still under heavy development. That means making 
binaries available would be very irresponsible from me because it can break 
anytime. Come around the project web page from time to time, there will be 
binaries as soon as Tarsius becomes stable.

DEVELOPERS
----------

So, you want to 'hack'? Forget about hacking, it's for complicated projects ;)
Seriously, Tarsius is all about simplicity: simple to use and simple to modify.
If you want to contribute, simply check out the source code and have a look.
Patches are always welcome. If you prefer to branch off the project, that's
fine with me (it's a free world!), but please make sure you replace the branding
and modify the code to avoid conflicts with Tarsius regarding configuration
before you make any binaries available on the web. Also, seriously consider the
option of contributing to Tarsius, either by backporting your modifications or
by sharing common components; there is already enough fragmentation of efforts 
in the open source community.

There is some info about development on Tarsius in the DEV file.

Thanks and happy coding!
